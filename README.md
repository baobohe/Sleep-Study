# Neurophysiological Correlates of Sleep

This repository contains the research work conducted on the neurophysiological correlates of sleep by a team at Johns Hopkins University. The following is an outline of each file's purpose and its role in the project. The research aims to investigate brain activity patterns across different age groups and assess how they impact health outcomes, with a specific focus on insomnia and sleep apnea.

## Overview

The project explores neurophysiological sleep patterns and their relationship to conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea. This interdisciplinary study combines neurophysiology, data mining, and machine learning to offer insights into sleep health and contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment methodologies.
