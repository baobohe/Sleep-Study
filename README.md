# Neurophysiological Correlates of Sleep

This repository contains research materials for the "Neurophysiological Correlates of Sleep" project conducted by the 'Sleeping Beauty' team at Johns Hopkins University. The project's goal is to investigate brain activity patterns across different age groups and assess how they impact health outcomes, with a specific focus on insomnia and sleep apnea.

## Overview

The project explores neurophysiological sleep patterns and their relationship to conditions such as insomnia and sleep apnea. This interdisciplinary study combines neurophysiology, data mining, and machine learning to offer insights into sleep health and contribute to improved diagnosis and treatment methodologies.

### Dataset

The dataset comprises over 4000 sleep recordings and related health data from the National Sleep Research Source. We employed MySQL for database management and merged the data using patient IDs to facilitate in-depth analysis.

### Data Processing and Analysis

- **Data Preprocessing**: Utilized tools like Excel Pivot Tables and Tableau, along with advanced data analytics methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
- **Machine Learning**: Applied AdaBoost algorithms and SVM for predictive modeling and extracted insights into age-specific sleep pattern variations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Synthesized findings into predictive models to aid in diagnosis and healthcare policy development.
